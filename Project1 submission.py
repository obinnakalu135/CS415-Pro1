Problem 2
The goal of this problem is to implement a modified primality test primality3: Given as

is divisible by any of these numbers output(”no”); else call primality2 with N and k as inputs.
(This in turn calls primality algorithm that randomly chooses a (where 1 < a < N) and tests
if a^N-1 ≡ 1(mod N) and repeats it k times to reduce the probability of error to 2^-k.)

Problem 3
Given integer k, generate a random prime number with n bits. Implement a solution as
follows: generate a random k - 2 binary string and add 1 as the first and the last bit to create
a k bit integer and convert it to decimal. (The reason for the first bit to be 1 is that we want
the number to be odd. The last bit should be 1 since we want no leading 0's.) Then, call
primality3 algorithm you in implemented in Problem 1 with n and k as inputs. (k is the second
parameter in primality2 which is the number of times the Fermat's test is repeated.) Repeat
calling primaility3 until it outputs 'yes'. At this point, you have found a prime number (with
a high probability if k is large enough).
